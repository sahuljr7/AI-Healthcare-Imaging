1. TensorFlow is developed by Google while PyTorch is developed by Facebook

2. TensorFlow offers a powerful but sometimes confusing low-level API for building neural networks and it can be a bit difficult to get started with. PyTorch on the other hand is easy to get started with and feels more natural if you're already familiar with Python.

3. TensorFlow is more widely used in the industry and has great support for deployment to Cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud. PyTorch is more widely used in machine learning and deep learning research but while it is possible to deploy PyTorch models to production it can be a bit harder than TensorFlow.

4. If you're new to deep learning then it is recommended starting with PyTorch because you will have an easier time learning it and you will find it easy to use if you already know the basics of deep learning. But, if want to deploy your models to production then you should be using TensorFlow.
